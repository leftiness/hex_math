# hex\_math

Useful stuff for working with a bunch of hexagons.

This is an implementation of the math described at [RedBlobGames][1]. There's
a lot of good information there. You should read it.

I'm using axial coordinates and converting to cuboid coordinates when
necessary. I've also added a coordinate to describe points in three dimensions.
